## About the project

This is just a small project for me to learn SQL and managing data as well as analyse data from it.
In addition, I want to create an app as userfriendly as possible to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Future updates will provide features like:
> * Personal profile area in frontend
> * Login form
> * More packages to analye the data from the database
> * Fixing security vulnerabilities

## Frontend Preview
> [!TIP]
> This project will be updated, so the colors and other userinterface elements could be changed in design and behavior.
